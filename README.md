# GT4-code-quiz
This is a javascript driven quiz page. When the user starts the quiz, they are shown a series of questions where they must select an answer. Selecting the wrong answer will decrease the time remaining. Once they complete the quiz, the time remaining is converted into a score that can be saved to local storage.
